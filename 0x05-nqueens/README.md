The “0x05. N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.

Concepts Needed:
Backtracking Algorithms:

Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
Backtracking Introduction
Recursion:

Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
Recursion in Python
List Manipulations in Python:

Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
Python Lists
Python Command Line Arguments:

Handling command-line arguments with the sys module.
